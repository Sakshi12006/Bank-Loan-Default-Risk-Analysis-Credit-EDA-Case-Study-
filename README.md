# Bank Loan Default Risk Analysis (Credit EDA)
*A Case Study in Risk Analytics for Banking & Financial Services*

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project identifies patterns in loan application data to minimize the risk of financial loss. The goal is to ensure that applicants capable of repaying are not rejected while high-risk 'defaulters' are identified using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 📈 Key Insights from EDA
- **Gender Risk:** Default rates for female customers are significantly lower than males.
- **Education & Income:** Customers with Higher Education and secondary education are the safest segments.
- **Occupation Impacts:** Drivers and low-skill laborers show the highest default rates, while Accountants and Laborers are safer.
- **Loan Type:** Most defaults occur in 'Cash Loans' rather than 'Revolving Loans'.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Analysis:** Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis, Outlier Treatment, Imbalance Handling.
